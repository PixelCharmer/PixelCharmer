I embarked on my coding journey as a self-paced learner, contemplating a shift from Recruitment to Software Engineering. Upon committing to this career transition, I enrolled in Promineo Tech's bootcamps, where I delved into both front-end and back-end courses. It was during this immersive experience that I discovered a genuine passion for front-end development, reveling in the artistry of creating beautiful and impactful digital experiences
